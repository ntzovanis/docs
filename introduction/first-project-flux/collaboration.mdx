## Collaboration
Being an online platform, Flux is already built for collaboration and can support the kinds of workflows found in modern engineering teams.

Most modern PCB designs are part of a multidisciplinary effort. PCB designers, mechanical engineers, and manufacturers will need to provide input on a design. Flux **was built to support the type of collaboration professional designers require**.

Some Flux features that support collaboration include Sharing and permissions, and comments.

### Sharing and permissions
In Flux, you have **complete control over who can view, edit, or comment on your projects**. You can choose to keep your project completely private, share it only with specific users, or make it publicly available by clicking on the "Share" menu on the top right.

**Sharing a project is as easy as copying and sending the URL**. Remember that whoever receives the URL needs to have been granted access to the project. Here's more information about the different access levels.
