#### These are the foundational principles that Flux was built on inspired by our experience working with world-class hardware teams.

## Never start from scratch

#### We believe that enabling seamless re-usability can amplify the impact of individuals and organizations.

Most hardware projects start from scratch because it’s difficult to find relevant projects you can trust, re-build them in your tool of choice, and sync part libraries.

Flux was built from the ground up with re-usability in mind at every level. We make it easy to find templates, projects, and components to give you a head start, as well as create your own re-usable components. 

- **Start with templates** for popular platforms like [Arduino](https://www.flux.ai/sitemap/project-templates/arduino), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.flux.ai/sitemap/project-templates/raspberry-pi), [ESP32](https://www.flux.ai/sitemap/project-templates/raspberry-pi), and [others published by the community](https://www.flux.ai/sitemap/project-templates) and even create your own.
- [Re-use components](/Introduction/flux-walkthrough-3-schematic-editor#community-library) built and tested by some of the best engineers in the world instead of making them yourself. No more importing and syncing libraries. 
- **Re-use sections of a layout**, called [auto$](/tutorials/tutorial-parts-and-sublayouts), to drop in fully functional regions to your design like a USB-C module instead of starting from scratch. 

## Work smarter, not harder

#### We believe that hardware design doesn’t need to be hard, you just need to have the right tools to make design easier.

Sometimes, the hardest part of designing hardware is figuring out how to use your EDA tool. EDA tools are meant to take the load off the designer, but most of the time they just make life harder.

Flux is constantly developing new features and workflows that take the difficulty out of design. We believe that the right EDA tool should help you work smarter, not harder.

- [Flux Copilot](https://docs.flux.ai/tutorials/ai-for-hardware-design) is Flux’s chat-based AI design assistant that acts as a personalized design expert at your side at all times. 
- Get real-time advice and feedback on your design to find out if you made mistakes and avoid them altogether.
- Have Copilot make design suggestions and implement those changes to your project for you. 

## Work better together

#### We believe the best hardware teams break down communication barriers and make it easy to keep stakeholders in the loop.

Building hardware often requires coordination with teammates, clients, manufacturers, and other stakeholders. So, why is it that traditional EDA software makes it so hard to work together? 

Flux lives in the browser and enables seamless collaboration with anyone just by sharing a link. Get feedback during your design process instead of waiting for formal design reviews cycles.

- **Just like Google docs**, [invite others to collaborate](/reference/reference-sharing-and-permissions#share-menu) while controlling viewing, editing and commenting permissions. 
- **[Automated version control](/tutorials/version-control---deep-dive)** makes it easy to track every single change and revert your project to a previous state
- **Get professional feedback quickly** from our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/fluxcommunity/shared_invite/zt-p48n941f-wzQ06kGmuFJ2HXnGYT1JkA) and others by sharing a link and [getting comments](/reference/reference-comments) right where the action is!

## Stay in the flow

#### We believe that reducing distractions and repetitive tasks can keep you in the flow and recapture the fun of making hardware.

Traditional EDA tools take you out of the design flow with modals on top of modals, requiring you to switch between different applications, miles deep config menus and performing repetitive tasks.

Flux integrates key workflows into a single app to keep you in the flow and reduce distractions.

- [A built-in SPICE simulator](/tutorials/the-simulator) allows you to check designs as you work. Use popular simulator models and program totally new functionality.
- **Choose specific parts later** with [generic components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeRI23uPTLA) that let you you make decisions about MPN, package size, and more, later on.
- [Check pricing & availability](/reference/reference-inspector-pricing-and-availability) of all major distributors - such as Digi-Key, Mouser, and LCSC - without leaving the app.
