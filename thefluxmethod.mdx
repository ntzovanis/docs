## Never start from scratch

<Check>We believe that enabling seamless re-usability can amplify the impact of individuals and organizations.</Check>

Most hardware projects start from scratch because itâ€™s difficult to find relevant projects you can trust, re-build them in your tool of choice, and sync part libraries.

Flux was built from the ground up with re-usability in mind at every level. We make it easy to find templates, projects, and components to give you a head start, as well as create your own re-usable components.

- **Start with templates** for popular platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and others published by the community and even create your own.
- Re-use components built and tested by some of the best engineers in the world instead of making them yourself. No more importing and syncing libraries.
-** Re-use sections of a layout**, called What is a Module?, to drop in fully functional regions to your design like a USB-C module instead of starting from scratch.

## Work better together

<Check>We believe the best hardware teams break down communication barriers and make it easy to keep stakeholders in the loop.</Check>

Building hardware often requires coordination with teammates, clients, manufacturers, and other stakeholders. So, why is it that traditional EDA software makes it so hard to work together?

Flux lives in the browser and enables seamless collaboration with anyone just by sharing a link. Get feedback during your design process instead of waiting for formal design reviews cycles.

- **Just like Google docs**, invite others to collaborate while controlling viewing, editing and commenting permissions.
- Automated version control makes it easy to track every single change and revert your project to a previous state
- **Get professional feedback quickly** from our Slack Community and others by sharing a link and getting comments right where the action is!

## Stay in the flow

<Check>We believe that reducing distractions and repetitive tasks can keep you in the flow and recapture the fun of making hardware.</Check>

Traditional EDA tools take you out of the design flow with modals on top of modals, requiring you to switch between different applications, miles deep config menus and performing repetitive tasks.

Flux integrates key workflows into a single app to keep you in the flow and reduce distractions.

- A built-in SPICE simulator allows you to check designs as you work. Use popular simulator models and program totally new functionality.
- **Choose specific parts later** with generic components that let you you make decisions about MPN, package size, and more, later on.
- Check pricing & availability of all major distributors - such as Digi-Key, Mouser, and LCSC - without leaving the app.
